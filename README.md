# TENsSites.github.io
https://tenssites.github.io/ is the URL of my "Stylish Lenses" example site

__________________________
"Stylish Lenses" created as an example of this scenario:

(1.) Customer wants this design exactly.
(2.) Recommendations given.
Customer didn't want any changes to the design.
__________________________

My recommendation:
  Move Contact section to top of page,
  immediately visible to users without having to scroll down
  and hunt.
    
	Customer's response:
  	No changes that would alter this exact layout / design.

My recommendation:
  Two links on the nav-bar are unavailable to small screen users.
  Avoid hiding content from (mobile) users.

	Customer's response:
  	Customer does not plan to add more content. Since it is 
  	such a small page, the user only has to scroll down a little to
	reach those less-important sections.
